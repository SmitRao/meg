The "dockmeg.pem" file is a secret key associated with our AWS EC2 instance, and should not be exposed publicly.

Smit has the file saved locally if anyone needs it. 

When deploying, make sure you...

1) cd into the folder where you've saved dockmeg.pem
2) Know the path to the /meg/backend directory "~/path/to/meg/backend"

When you're ready, enter the following commands for deployment (replacing ~/path/to/meg/backend appropriately):

scp -r -i dockmeg.pem ~/path/to/meg/backend ec2-user@3.88.174.215:~/
ssh -i dockmeg.pem ec2-user@3.88.174.215
cd backend && dockdown && dockup

Test the deployment by heading over to http://ec2-3-88-174-215.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5000/
