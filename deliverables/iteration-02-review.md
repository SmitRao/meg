 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Monday March 9 2020
 * Where: Bahen Centre for Information Technology

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * Our set communication rules were extremely effective, there was constant communication between team-members and sub-groups via Slack

 * Meetings between D1 and D2 were frequent. There were set weekly meetings however we met up more than we had planned which led to a better outcome.

* Our meeting minutes were well organized and we kept up with them after every meeting with our partner in order to reflect and respond.


#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * We hoped that the Trello board would be an effective way to keep up-to-date regarding which tasks needed to be completed. However, this proved to not be as successful. Instead we kept each other and our partner updated via Slack which was our main way of communicating.

 * Rather than doing individual work and setting up meetings for code-review, we instead set meetings with our group to do the work using pair programming. This proved to be a successful way to work as everyone was together and any questions that someone had could be answered by someone with more experience. 


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * We want to be slghtly more organized with our code-review process. We found that the pair-programming that we did was very effective in helping us complete our tasks, however in order to have better documentation and keep a written report on the progress of our work, we should try to heed to our original code-review process. 


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
