# My Ethical Garment (MEG)

## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Monday March 9 2020
 * Where: Bahen Centre for Information Technology

## Process - Reflection

#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * Our set communication rules were  effective; there was constant communication between team-members and sub-groups via Slack

 * Meetings between D1 and D2 were frequent. Although we set weekly meetings, we met more than we had planned, which led to a better outcome.

 * Additionally, in terms of splitting up tasks, we believe that our method for splitting into smaller subgroups where each person was working in at least 2 groups was beneficial to making the workload of this deliverable more manageable between the six team members.
 
* Rather than doing individual work and setting up meetings for code-review, we instead set meetings with our group and completed the majority of our second deliverable using pair programming. Pair-programming proved to be a successful way to work as everyone was together, and someone with more experience could answer any questions that another team member had.



#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

* Our original plan was to use brand API's in order to gain access to their information. However, as it was difficult to get in touch with them, we found ourselves not being able to start working on the project. We believe that we should have made the decision to turn to web-scraping sooner rather than waiting for a response from the brands. 

 * We hoped that the Trello board would be an effective way to keep up-to-date regarding incomplete tasks. However, this proved not to be as successful. Instead, we updated each other, and our partner via Slack, which was our primary way of communicating.

 * Although pair programming proved to be beneficial, it should not have been a replacement for code-review. Our codebase is not as organized as we would've liked it to be due to this. 

 


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * We want to be more organized with our code-review process. As we completed the majority of our work using pair programming, we didn't set up meetings specifically for code review.  Although pair programming was very effective in helping us complete our tasks, it came with a few caveats concerning code organization. We feel that in order to have better documentation and keep a written report on the progress of our work, we should try to heed our original code-review process. 

 * Additionally, we want to start using our Trello board more as a way to keep up to date on the _priority_ of each task. There are many moving parts in our deliverable but it was difficult communicating where each of us should be focusing our time when the deadline was looming.




## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * Since we were not able to demo a deployed version of our product and there are a lot of moving parts that haven't been completely connected, we showcased each individual component of the app to our partner. We walked through the data-retrieval process (scraping) and how that information was put into the database. We also walked through how the front-end was designed and how the user can navigate from page to page.

 * Our partner accepted all of the functionality features for this iteration.

 * Our partner had a few small requests in regards to how the UI looks- specifically for the layout of the splash page as well as being able to access the how-it-works page from anywhere page on the site (adding it to our navigation bar).
